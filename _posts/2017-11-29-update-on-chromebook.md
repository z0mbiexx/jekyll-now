title: Updates on my chromebook
---

so i seen https://galliumos.org/ since its one that can be used with chrx
to dualboot chromeOS and linux.. well i reinstalled mrchromebox's legacy
firmware.. and i can now say https://galliumos.org/ is running itself on
the chromebook with working sound.. so i have successfully converted the
chromebook into a full working linux laptop.. with a distro that is
designed specifically for chromebooks based on the chipset with kernel mods
for sound etc.. and its all based on xubuntu
