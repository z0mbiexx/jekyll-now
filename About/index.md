Self taught computer nerd. I love doing web developing, I dabble in graphic design and Photography. Watching movies and TV is one of my favorite past times. I currently run the local computer repair shop, play video games on consoles but mainly PC so therefore i dual boot Windows 10 and Manjaro/Arch-based distros depending on what im doing at the moment.
