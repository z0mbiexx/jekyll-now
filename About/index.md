I am a self taught computer nerd. i love doing web developing, I dabble in graphic design and such. I am currently in college for network technologies and learning to use my DSLR camera better, as well as learning more about linux and github when i have time. I Play video games on consoles but mainly PC so therefore i dual boot Windows 10 and Antergos depending on what im doing on my PC.
